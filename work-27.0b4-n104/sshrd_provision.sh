# Run on the HOST with the device booted into SSHRD. It stages payloads over
# ssh and runs the device-side work, then verifies. Every step is idempotent:
# re-running is safe and already-done steps are skipped, so this can be used
# both for a fresh restore and to top up a device after a partial run.
#
# The System volume is read-only on a normal boot, which is the only reason any
# of this needs SSHRD at all. Group it here so one trip does the lot.
