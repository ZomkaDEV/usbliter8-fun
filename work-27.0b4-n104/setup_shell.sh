#
# Three separate annoyances, all fixed here:
#
#   1. dropbear complains twice per login that /var/log/lastlog does not exist.
#   2. The prompt is a bare `-sh-3.2#`, because /etc/passwd gives root /bin/sh
#      and sh has no prompt configured.
#   3. zsh has to be started by hand, and then has no prompt either.
#
# The proper fix for 2 is changing root's login shell in /etc/passwd, but that
# file is on the read-only System volume and would need an SSHRD trip. Everything
# here lives on the Data volume instead: /var/root and /var/log are both writable
# on a normal boot, and both survive reboots. Only an erase restore wipes them,
# which is why this is a script rather than something you do by hand.
#
# Deliberately NOT part of sshrd_provision.sh. That script exists for things that
# require the System volume mounted read-write, and refuses to run on a normal
# boot for that reason. None of this needs SSHRD, so folding it in there would
# force a DFU cycle for a cosmetic change.
#
# Requires the bootstrap, since zsh comes from it. Run install_bootstrap.sh first.
