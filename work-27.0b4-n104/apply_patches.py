Apply firmware patches with a hard assertion on the original bytes.

The upstream usbliter8-fun scripts write patches blind: `fp.seek(off); fp.write(word)`.
If an offset is wrong, or right for a different build, the write still succeeds and you
find out on the device, from a boot that hangs with no useful output.

Every patch here carries the word we believe is currently at that offset. Nothing is
written unless the file actually contains it. A wrong offset fails at the desk instead
of on the phone.

    ./apply_patches.py ibss-restore iBSS.raw -o out.raw    verify then write

Offsets below are for n104 / 24A5390f only; see README.md in this directory.

both. Verified: sha256 of both extracted payloads is 6cf70de6...

# does not boot. Both paths fail `cmp w0, 1`, so the state has to be SYNTHESISED.

#     locked = 0x1, noPin = 0x2, beenUnlocked = 0x4
# Bit 2 was confirmed here directly: both _MKBDeviceUnlockedSinceBoot and
# _MKBUserUnlockedSinceBoot end in `ubfx w0, w8, #2, #1`. Bits 0 and 1 were confirmed
# against the AppleKeyStore constants during review. 0x6 is also the self-consistent state
# for this device, which genuinely has no passcode after the erase restore: no PIN, not
# locked, has been unlocked.
#
# SCOPE. This does not make the broad AKS stub coherent. _MKBGetDeviceLockState goes through
# __get_device_lock_state with a larger struct and reads [sp,#0x4], a different path that
# this shim does not touch. Deliberately minimal: every selector except 7 keeps the exact

# Our code touches neither SP nor LR, so the pacibsp/retab pairing stays balanced.

# USB Restricted Mode bypass.

# Source, checked against wh1te4ever/usbliter8-fun directly: this is NOT wh1te4ever's.
# Upstream's work-27.0b2/get_boot.py (25793 bytes) has zero occurrences of it, and their
# b3 scripts are byte-identical to ours. Our fork's b2 (27361 bytes) carries it as part of
# a set of third-party additions, all commented in Vietnamese. So it was never "dropped in
# b3"; b3 never had it. Correcting my earlier claim of an upstream regression.
#
# isDeviceInRestoreMode() forced to return 1 makes the USB stack believe it is restoring,
# so USB Restricted Mode never engages and usbmux/lockdown come up before unlock or
# activation. That matters enormously here: this device has no working display, so it can
# never be unlocked, and Restricted Mode therefore blocks USB data forever. It is why the
# device has never once enumerated on a normal boot while working fine in DFU, recovery
# and SSHRD. b2's comment also warns that the DeviceTree alternative
# (disable-transport-rm=1) bricked normal boot, so do not go that route.
#
# Derivation, b2 0x2894b68 -> b4 0x28a5bdc (VA 0xfffffff0098a9bdc):
#   masked signature failed (the body diverges at a global struct offset), so this came

#   +0x2c; that string sits in a distinctive cluster
#   ('1211...', 'rd', 'rootdev', '-restore', '%02X', '%02X ', '<print error>') which

#
# Without these, every binary under /var/jb dies at load:
#
#   dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libiosexec.1.dylib
#     Reason: file system sandbox blocked mmap() of '/private/var/jb/usr/lib/libiosexec.1.dylib'
#
# which kills dpkg, apt, uicache, Sileo and the rest of the Procursus bootstrap. iOS's own
# userland is tiny (/bin holds only cat, df, ls, ps, sh), so almost everything useful lives
# in /var/jb and is unusable until these are neutered.
#
# DERIVED, not copied. Upstream publishes offsets for their 24A5370h/d421 build and also,
# usefully, the method (work-27.0b2/get_boot.py:245):
#
#   mac_policy_conf("Sandbox" / "Seatbelt sandbox policy") -> mpc_ops (+32) -> ops[index]
#   entries are chained-fixup auth pointers, target in the low 32 bits
#
# Applied to both kernelcaches:
#
#             "Sandbox"   "Seatbelt sandbox policy"   mac_policy_conf   mpc_ops
#   b2/d421   0xb32c78    0xb30e8b                    0x10feaa0         0x10fe028

#
# Exactly one struct in each image has a pointer to "Sandbox" at +0 and one to "Seatbelt
# sandbox policy" at +8, so there is no ambiguity about which policy we found.
#
# Three independent checks before trusting the result:
#
#  1. Running the derivation on the b2 kernelcache reproduces upstream's five published
#     offsets EXACTLY (0x2f774e0, 0x2f75640, 0x2f75474, 0x2f75110, 0x2f7019c).
#  2. The PAC discriminators in the raw pointers are identical across the two builds
#     (0x8020438d, 0x8010bd41, 0x80201586, 0x8010bcad, 0x80101042), which proves we are
#     reading the same struct slots and not coincidentally-similar tables.
#  3. Every target's first four instructions are byte-identical between b2 and b4, and all
#     start with pacibsp, so they are genuine function entries.
#
# Note the file offsets are also virtual addresses minus 0xFFFFFFF007004000: every segment
# in this kernelcache is flat-mapped (__TEXT_EXEC vm 0xfffffff008174000 -> file 0x1170000,
# and 0x8174000 - 0x7004000 == 0x1170000). Reading them with r2 against the Mach-O gives
# 0xffffffff, because r2 maps by VA; that is a tooling artefact, not bad data.

# --- iBEC display diagnostics: is pinot_init returning 0 or -1? ----------------------
#
# These are DIAGNOSTICS, not fixes. They are not part of any boot table and must be
# selected by name. Apply them on top of an already-"ibss-normal"-patched iBEC.raw; the
# offsets do not collide with VALIDATE (0x23728/0x2372c) or bootargs (0x2aa28/0x2aa2c
# and the blob at 0xd0e30), so the sha256 line will read MODIFIED and that is expected.
#
# Background is in work-27.0b4-n104/README.md, display section. In short:
#
#   pinot_init is 0x9e268, reached from the generic display wrapper through slot 0 of
#   the function table at 0x1302d8. It returns 0 or -1 and nothing else. The -1 has
#   exactly one predecessor in the whole function:
#
#       0x9e500  ldr w8, [x25, 0xab0]   ; state->panel_id
#       0x9e504  cbz w8, 0x9e684        ; == 0 -> bl 0x1f8e4 ; mov w0, -1 ; ret
#
#   panel_id is filled from, in order: a value cached by an earlier call, the env var
#   "pinot-panel-id", or a MIPI DSI Generic Read (data type 0x14) of panel register 0xb1
#   at 0x9e42c. A failed or short read leaves it 0, so a failed read is fatal. There is
#   no fallback configuration path, which rules out the "tolerated failure still returns
#   0" theory for this build.
#
#   The wrapper then does cbz w0, 0x96b10 and on non-zero zeroes the display object out.
#
# We cannot currently observe which of the two happened. Every value we were reading back
# with `irecovery -s` is an INPUT: backlight-level, display-timing and display-color-space
# are all fetched by env readers (0xa6470 / 0xa634c), never written by the display path.
# backlight-level's 1435 is an NVRAM leftover from the device's last normal iOS session;
# the name is an entry in iBoot's env-var table at 0x119680. So these two patches exist to
# turn that unknown into an observation.
#
# Run them one at a time, never together, and keep an unpatched control boot for
# comparison. The three cases are:
#
#   A  no diagnostic patch          real MIPI read, real failure behaviour (the control)
#   B  ibec-diag-ignore-pinot-id-failure
#   C  ibec-diag-force-pinot-id     supply an ID, skip the MIPI read entirely
#
# --- B ---
# Redirect the failure branch to the known success return rather than NOPing it.
#
# NOPing 0x9e504 would let a zero panel_id fall into 0x9e508, the full bring-up sequence,
# which normally only ever runs with a valid ID. That adds a second unknown ("what does
# bring-up do when handed 0?") on top of the one we are trying to measure. Redirecting to
# 0x9e67c instead changes exactly one thing: the failure stops being reported as failure.
#
#   0x9e67c  mov w0, 0
#   0x9e680  b   0x9e68c        -> shared epilogue, retab
#
# 0x9e67c is safe to enter directly. It is inside the same frame, sets w0, and falls into
# the epilogue that restores x19-x28/x29/x30 and adds 0x90 to sp. Nothing between 0x9e504
# and 0x9e67c is required for that epilogue to be correct.
#
# A side effect worth knowing: this also skips `bl 0x1f8e4` on the failure path. 0x1f8e4
# writes 0x1fffff to a DSIM register (base 0x230400a0, +0x24) and is almost certainly the
# mipi_dsim_quiesce() seen in the historical n104 log. Skipping it leaves the DSIM powered
# rather than shut down, which for this experiment is what we want.
#
# Reading the result:
#   any change at all, including backlight flicker or a different black level
#       -> the Pinot failure/teardown path is involved, i.e. it was returning -1
#   no change whatsoever
#       -> does NOT prove the read succeeded. It only proves that keeping the display
#          object alive is not by itself sufficient. Panel programming may still need a
#          real ID, which is what C is for.

#
# Overwriting the default alone is not enough, because MOVZ carries only 16 bits and a
# panel ID is 32 (bits 24..31 are reply byte 0). So both words go: the constant is built
# in w0 with MOVZ+MOVK and the env lookup is dropped. 0x9e3dc and 0x9e3e0 are untouched
# and do the rest. The dead x0..x3 setup at 0x9e3bc..0x9e3d0 is harmless: w0 is
# overwritten here and the decode at 0x9e4a8 only reads w0 and x8.
#
# This one needs a real panel ID from this exact panel, which we do NOT have. Do not
# invent one. The layout, decoded from 0x9e444..0x9e484, is:
#
#   bits  0..2   reply[2] & 7          bits  8..11  (reply[2] >> 4) & 0xf
#   bits  3..5   reply[3] & 7          bits 12..15  (reply[3] >> 4) & 0xf
#   bit   6      (reply[3] >> 3) & 1   bits 16..23  reply[1]
#   bit   7      (reply[2] >> 3) & 1   bits 24..31  reply[0]
#
# and (panel_id & 0x3f) == 8 is the case that triggers the extra decode at 0x9e4b4, which
# means reply[2] & 7 == 0 and reply[3] & 7 == 1.

# the panel-ID read. Same code, same patches, opposite outcome, so the difference is

    #
    # WRONG, corrected 2026-08-07. The search looked in the wrong binary. There are two
    # separate boot arguments living in two separate programs:
    #
    #   /sbin/launchd                      launchd_no_cache=        1 match, unsecure 0
    #   /usr/libexec/launchd_cache_loader  launchd_unsecure_cache=  1 match, no_cache 0
    #
    # We grepped only /sbin/launchd, found no "launchd_unsecure_cache", and concluded the
    # flag was gone from iOS 27. It is not gone; it belongs to the cache loader. The
    # loader's own strings settle it:
    #
    #   0x1d30  "Using default cache paths"      <- what our launchd_cache_loader.log showed
    #   0x1dce  "launchd_unsecure_cache="
    #   0x1de6  "Using unsecure cache: %s"       <- the path we never reached
    #
    # So upstream's flag was right all along and ours silently selected the signed-cache
    # path. That is very likely why no daemon we placed was ever started, and why we ended
    # up hijacking a cached job instead.
    #
    # Switching to upstream's flag. Expected evidence on the next boot is "Using unsecure
    # cache:" in /var/log/com.apple.xpc.launchd/launchd_cache_loader.log instead of "Using
    # default cache paths". If it still says default, the loader recognises the argument
    # but refuses the branch, and the next step is reversing the loader around 0x1dce
