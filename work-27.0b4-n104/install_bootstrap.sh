# Source: bootstrap_1900.tar.zst here, byte-identical to ../work-27.0b2/bootstrap_1900.tar.zst
#   20.7 MB compressed, 103 MB extracted, 6529 entries, all uid 0.
#   1151 symlinks and 8 setuid binaries (sudo, su, passwd, login, chpass, newgrp,
#   quota, shshd).
#
# Why the archive is transferred and extracted ON THE DEVICE rather than scp -r'd:
# scp -r dereferences symlinks. With 1151 of them the tree would be wrong and far
# larger. The ramdisk has GNU tar 1.17, which preserves symlinks, ownership and
# setuid bits when run as root, so we send one .tar.gz and unpack it there.
#
# We ship .tar.gz rather than the original .zst because the ramdisk has no zstd.
# Repack verified lossless: uid 0 on all 6529 entries, all 8 setuid bits intact.
#
# Path mapping: on the device /var IS the Data volume, and under SSHRD the Data
# volume is /mnt2. Confirmed by /mnt2/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/ existing, which on
# a booted device is /var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/. So /var/jb == /mnt2/jb.
#
# This installs FILES ONLY. It does not run prep_bootstrap.sh, which needs to
# execute on a booted device (all its paths are absolute /var/jb/..., and /var on
# the ramdisk is read-only so it cannot be redirected). See the closing note.
